# Bootsplate V 0.0.4 ( January 23, 2020)

### Back after 5 Years

### Bootsplate is a Standard HTML Boilerplate that includes Bootstrap v4.4.1 and Everything else you need to start your next Project. It was carefully crafted with everything you need to get your Project up and ready without worry. Just clone / download the repo and start working. 

* jQuery, Modernizr in place. With Old version for Compatibility. 
* index.html has a standard HTML5 layout, start coding.
* Barebone 404 Page with Separate CSS. 
* Boostrap v4.4.1 Production Ready, with JS and CSS Map. 
* A Slightly modified browser compatibility package from html5-boilerplate.
* editorconfig, gitattributes, gitignore, htaccess in place.

Get a Cup of Coffee and start coding.

`git clone https://github.com/oritromax/bootsplate.git`

Or if you prefer to download, that option is also there. 

## Why?

This started as a personal need. I wanted to get up and running with a project and i needed to either bower ( remember bower? ) everything or copy paste from other projects. Thats just a few extra step i am trying to avoid. So i put together a small package with everything you may need to jump start your project. Keep cloning for future project and you have somewhat of a ready base to start from. 

Nuff Said, lets get to work.

## Getting Started

As you already know its a combination of [html5-boilerlate](http://html5boilerplate.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). So there isn't much to talk about. Lets take a look under the hood.

#### Style Element(s)

* [Normalize] (https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) to keep stuff smooth everywhere.
* `main.css` The main Stylesheet for the Site, Comes with html5-boilerplate.
* `bootstrap` Nothing to explain really !

>Bootstrap do have all the Normalize style built in, so not included in index.html. Kept if someone wants to use something other then Bootstrap

#### Extra Element(s)

## Production Rediness

### jQuery Version suit up

There are Four different version of jQuery included in the package. v1.10.2, v1.11.2, v2.1.3, v3.4.1, all minified and production ready. You can choose between any of those you fill comfortable with.

`jQuery 2.1.3 and above Doesn't support Internet Explorer 6,7,8. Unless you are planning to built your website / application for modern browsers only, you should use jQuery 1.x versions. Two of them ( v1.10.2 and v1.11.2) are included here.`
