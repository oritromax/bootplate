## Why?

Was working with bootstrap and html5-boilerplate. Its not that tough to use these two togather. But to save some time, i tried to search for a already available boilerplate. But whatever came on first place, didn't quite the thing i was expecting. To me, that was kinda klingon stuff for wanna-be-nerd people. So thought about coming with a simple solution which is as simple as it need to be and will be easy-to-use for both wanna-be-nerd and already-nerd people.

Nuff Said, lets get to work.

## Getting Started

As you already know its a combination of [html5-boilerlate](http://html5boilerplate.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). So there isn't much to talk about. Lets take a look under the hood.

#### Style Element(s)

* [Normalize] (https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) to keep stuff smooth everywhere.
* `bootstrap.css` The core bootstrap Stylesheet.
* `bootstrap-theme.css` Bootstrap theme, comes with bootstrap 3.3.1.
* `main.css` The main Stylesheet for the Site, Comes with html5-boilerplate.
* `bootstrap-theme.css.map` Bootstrap Theme Map file added.
* `bootstrap.css.map` Bootstrap Main Css map added.

#### Javascript Element(s)

* `jquery-1.10.2.min.js` jQuery 1.10.2, for the awesome power of jQuery.
* `jquery-1.11.2.min.js` jQuery 1.11.2, the latest 1.x version of jQuery.
* `jquery-2.1.3.min.js` jQuery 2.1.3, the latest 2.x version of jQuery.
* `bootstrap.js` Bootstrap JS, Comes with bootstrap 3.3.1.
* `modernizr-2.6.2.min.js` Modernizr, To handle the fools.
* `plugin.js` For building jQuery plugin, Comes with html5-boilerplate.
* `main.js` For your custom Javascript, Comes with html5-boilerplate.

#### Extra Element(s)

## Production Rediness

### jQuery Version suit up

There are three different version of jQuery included in the package. v1.10.2, v1.11.2 and v2.1.3, all minified and production ready. You can choose between any of those you fill comfortable with.

`jQuery 2.1.3 Doesn't support Internet Explorer 6,7,8. Unless you are planning to built your website / application for modern browsers only, you should use jQuery 1.x versions. Two of them ( v1.10.2 and v1.11.2) are included here.`

As its for Development, All the Stylesheet and Scripts of Bootstrap are included as non-minified version.

* Change `bootstrap.css` to `bootstrap.min.css`, if you are ready for production.
* Change `bootstrap-theme.css` to `bootstrap-theme.min.css`
* Change `bootstrap.js` to `bootstrap.min.js`

> Only if you didn't make any change(s) to bootstrap core files.
